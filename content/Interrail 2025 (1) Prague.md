# Public transportation to Prague

Initially I had planned on using an Interrail pass for all my long-distance trains, however checking with Deutsche Bahn it turned out that the ticket price to get to Prague was only around 27€, much lower than the average cost of a travel day with the Interrail pass of roughly 50€. As I didn't plan on taking another train after my 6h journey to Prague, it made more sense to purchase the ticket separately. Funnily enough, when comparing ticket prices, booking only Munich - Prague would have cost me almost 70€, but Augsburg - Munich - Prague cost 27€. This is either a bug or due to the fact that the longer journey contains a Deutsch Bahn train and thus profits from Deutsche Bahn bonus campaigns currently running. Either way, the choice was a no-brainer. What I had not checked however, was the connection time in Munich which ended up only being 14 minutes. In the future I would leave more time for my layover just in case there are delays. Yes, passenger rights allow you to take a later train if you miss yours due to delays, however that means you'll lose 1-2h so I don't think it's worth the risk.

## The RE 25 / EC 355

The train with a direct connection between the Munich and Prague main stations arrived around 10 minutes late, so no issues with the connection. Seats were readily available and provided the usual comfort of regional trains, still headphones are definitely recommended.

In case you have a strong preference for being seated in the direction of travel the train switches direction in Regensburg, around 1:30h in.
