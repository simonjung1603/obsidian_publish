# Public transportation to Prague

Initially I had planned on using an Interrail pass for all my long-distance trains, however checking with Deutsche Bahn it turned out that the ticket price to get to Prague was only around 27€, much lower than the average cost of a travel day with the Interrail pass of roughly 50€. As I didn't plan on taking another train after my 6h journey to Prague, it made more sense to purchase the ticket separately. Funnily enough, when comparing ticket prices, booking only Munich - Prague would have cost me almost 70€, but Augsburg - Munich - Prague cost 27€. This is either a bug or due to the fact that the longer journey contains a Deutsch Bahn train and thus profits from Deutsche Bahn bonus campaigns currently running. Either way, the choice was a no-brainer. What I had not checked however, was the connection time in Munich which ended up only being 14 minutes. In the future I would leave more time for my layover just in case there are delays. Yes, passenger rights allow you to take a later train if you miss yours due to delays, however that means you'll lose 1-2h so I don't think it's worth the risk.

## The RE 25 / EC 355

The train with a direct connection between the Munich and Prague main stations arrived around 10 minutes late, so no issues with the connection. Seats were readily available and provided the usual comfort of regional trains, still headphones are definitely recommended.

In case you have a strong preference for being seated in the direction of travel the train switches direction in Regensburg, around 1:30h in.

## A visit from the police

Around 10:50 AM four border control and police officers came through checking IDs and sampling selected suitcases looking for knives, drugs, and goods needing declaration. They didn't end up checking me but two Czech passengers I briefly sat with in the beginning until a window spot opened up and I moved.

# Planning the itinerary

I used the time on the train to procrastinate on some work that still needed catching up and instead researched some activities for my time in the city. I liked the idea of taking a walking tour early on to get an overview over some of the most popular sight and then have the opportunity to re-visit places that I felt I didn't get enough time with. I found some free walking tours by [100 spires](https://www.tours-prague.eu/tour-oldtown-free.phtml) and reserved a spot for 3 PM today, hoping I'll make it there in time.

The tour takes about three hours with the following sights visited:
- Municipal House
- Powder Gate
- House at the Black Madonna
- Charles University (Carolinum)
- The Estates Theatre
- Old Town Square
- The Church of Our Lady before Tyn
- Jan Hus Monument
- Astronomical Clock
- Franz Kafka Statue
- Spanish Synagogue
- Paris Street
- The Old-New Synagogue
- The Jewish Town Hall
- The Old Jewish Cemetery
- The Ceremonial Hall
- Charles Bridge
- The John Lennon Wall

The walking tour supposedly includes some of the history and fun facts about the places, some basics of the Czech language and recommendations of what else to do in the city. Notably, it does not involve any "actual" visits of the places that charge admission fees, it being a free tour and all. This means for example, we will see the historic Jewish cemetery but won't go in. Definitely a place to come back to on one of the following two days.
