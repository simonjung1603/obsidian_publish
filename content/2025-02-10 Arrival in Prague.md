# The train station

![[IMG_20250210_143959.jpg|640]]

Arrival in Prague was smooth, if about 20 minutes late. Orientation was fairly easy and I was on my way to the AirBnB in the north-east of the Prague 1 district.

> [!info] Wonder why the name of the main station is Praha hl. n?
> The abbreviation stands for **Hlavní Nádraží** which is Czech for main station.
> Okay, but there is actually an interesting history behind the name. The station was originally built in 1866, opening in 1871 as **Franz Josef Station** after Austrian emperor at the time **Franz Joseph I**. During the **First Czechoslovak Republic** it was renamed to **Wilsonovo nádraží** after Woodrow Wilson who supported Czechoslovakia's self-determination until it was renamed to **Hlavní Nádraží** under German occupation during WW2. It was briefly renamed back to Wilson Station after the war but ultimately the name **Hlavní Nádraží** was kept.

# First impressions

![[IMG_20250210_144743.jpg|IMG_20250210_144743.jpg]]

It was clear from the start that Prague would be something special. My walk was filled with beautiful architecture wherever you looked and this wasn't even the sightseeing portion of the trip yet. There were cute red trams moving around and people here and there but you could take in the impressive buildings mostly undisturbed.

The place itself was located in [Biskupská 1065/1, 110 00 Nové Město](geo:50.0902435,14.4347855), but I first had to fetch my keys from a Minimarket nearby which worked without and problems. Getting in the apartment was a bit more of a challenge as the elevator was seemingly not working (it turned out to be a user error as you needed to tap a plastic button on your key chain while requesting the elevator) and you got three keys to open the door which had two key holes (one of which I still think is completely unused).

It didn't take me too long to get all of the process figured out but once got in there was no chance for me to still make it to the [[2025-02-11 The free walking tour|free walking tour]] in time.

Oh well, no problem. I rescheduled the tour for the next day and took some time to arrive, unpack and take in the view from my room:

After I felt a bit more refreshed I embarked on exploring the town on my own with a few destinations in mind.

## First destination: Coffee

Of course now that I had some time, why not start really relaxed with a nice hot cappuccino?
So I scouted the available café options (of which there are many) and picked "Minimum Waste" (for no particular reason other than being well rated and close by).

It's a great place, offering edible cups for your coffees to go. It's a chill vibe with lots of students working on their laptops and the barista was very friendly. You can scan a QR code which lets you order and pay online (which I opted for as I hadn't yet have the time to brush up on some Czech terms) but they do offer some additional foods and drinks you can't find on the online menu. I had a cappuccino and one of the spiciest bagels I every had. Delicious.

## Next up: Sightseeing

Looking at the map I decided to slowly head to the dancing house, as that would also lead my nicely through the old town, and the walk back along the river past the charles bridge and back to my AirBnB.

And what can I say. Everything is gorgeous here. I passed the old town square

followed by the astronomical clock and powder tower (the ceremonial entrance to the old town).

The beauty continues every way you look. It really is difficult to find a single boring building. I think the pictures speak for themselves.

You can see on the right in the previous picture that I reached the dancing house and it definitely is worth checking out but my eyes where all on the houses surrounding it.

Finally, accompanied by the sunset, I walked along the _Vltava River_ (river Moldau) approaching the Charles Bridge and the castle behind it on the other side.

As it was getting dark and I progressively more tired I did not cross the bridge all the way, leaving it for [[2025-02-11 The free walking tour|the next day]], and instead turned back towards my accommodation to get some well deserved rest.
