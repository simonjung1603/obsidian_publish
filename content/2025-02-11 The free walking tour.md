# Visiting the Old Town and Jewish Quarters

The [tour](https://www.tours-prague.eu/tour-oldtown-free.phtml) I booked took around two and a half to three hours and was led by Kamil. I booked the 10 AM slot so I would have extra time exploring afterwards
- Municipal House
- Powder Gate
- House at the Black Madonna
- Charles University (Carolinum)
- The Estates Theatre
- Old Town Square
- The Church of Our Lady before Tyn
- Jan Hus Monument
- Astronomical Clock
- Franz Kafka Statue
- Spanish Synagogue
- Paris Street
- The Old-New Synagogue
- The Jewish Town Hall
- The Old Jewish Cemetery
- The Ceremonial Hall
- Charles Bridge
- The John Lennon Wall

The walking tour supposedly includes some of the history and fun facts about the places, some basics of the Czech language and recommendations of what else to do in the city. Notably, it does not involve any "actual" visits of the places that charge admission fees, it being a free tour and all. This means for example, we will see the historic Jewish cemetery but won't go in. Definitely a place to come back to on one of the following two days.
