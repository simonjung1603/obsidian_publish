# Visiting the Old Town and Jewish Quarters

The [tour](https://www.tours-prague.eu/tour-oldtown-free.phtml) I booked took around two and a half to three hours and was led by Kamil. I booked the 10 AM slot so I would have extra time exploring afterwards. Meeting point was about 10 minutes from my apartment at the Powder Gate I already visited [[2025-02-10 Arrival in Prague|the day before]].

## Breaking the ice

Kamil welcomes everyone and teaches us our first Czech term: Ano ⬌ Yes.
We all repeat after him.

> [!cite] Kamil continues
> *Ano colloquially is often shortened to no, so if the waiter asks you whether you want another beer and you go:*
> *No, no, no, no! You'd be ordering another.*

He teaches us to use **Ne** instead, if we wanna say no but to definitely enjoy the beer as well.

## The entrance to the old town

Kamil describes Prague as a city of the old and the new ("An old new nation"). Old due to it's long history, new due to the repeated trans- and re-formations of the republic.

The gothic **Powder Tower** is one of the representatives of the old. Once part of six tours placed along the city wall, now the only remaining forms the ceremonial entrance to Prague's old town.

The **Municipal House** itself is a relatively new addition. The art nouveau style building was constructed in 1918 at the birth of Czechoslovakia in an attempt to revive and reinforce Czech culture.

We continue through the streets into an alleyway and stop in front of the **Charles University**. The same Charles the bridge is named after. Meant is Charles IV, born in 1316, big advocate of Prague and education, opening the university in 1348. Studying here is free for anyone, independent of origin, age or number of degrees, as long as the majority of courses taken are in the Czech language.

Walking past the Estates Theatre, another impressive building, we reach the **House of the Black Madonna** a building constructed in an experimental cubist style. Not only it's architecture is impressive but also several cubist dishes and glassware presented in display cases around the building.

> [!cite] Next lesson in Czech: Pivo ⬌ Beer
> Already a beverage of significant importance in Germany, this is true even more so for the Czech Republic, being the country with the highest consumption of beer per capita. Pilsner and Budvaz come from here. They also offer a peculiar way of ordering a slice of beer, referring to a beer consisting mostly of foam.

Kamil does not live in the city center anymore. Neither do his friends. He says that these apartments aren't for them anymore and means that the vast majority of apartments has been transformed into AirBnB's. On top of that, the apartments that are left simply aren't affordable.

He says: "50 times more people live in Prague today, compared to the times of Charles IV, yet 7 times less live in the city center". But he doesn't linger in negativity. "It is not a crisis for us to solve now but should you come up with a solution make sure to bring it in."

We continue to the **Old town hall** with its astronomical clock, being one of the oldest still working ones, built in 1410. As he teaches us how to read it, the mind wanders into times passed and how a day a life back then could have looked like.
## The Jewish Quarter

Walking through the Jewish Quarter, Kamil speaks of the two main historical enemies of Prague: fire and floods. We see the statue of a fireman on the very top of a building, heroically keeping an eye out on the town. We see water markings on the side of the buildings, keeping track of the water levels during historic floods. The latest and most destructive one in 2002. 

We traverse the Jewish Quarter, passing a statue of Franz Kafka who was born in Prague, several Synagogues, sections tiled with hand-crafted cobblestone and eventually arrive at the Jewish Cemetery. You only get a small peek of the inside standing on the streat below. The significance of this burial site is that once the entire allotted area was exhausted they started stacking graves vertically making it difficult to estimate how many people are buried without counting the gravestones.
## The Charles Bridge and district of Lesser Prague

Our travel group and its shepherd head to the final area of the tour: **Lesser Prague**. On the way we pass the **National Library** and Kamil show's us impressive pictures of the interior. Unfortunately, you can only visit in conjunction with a guided tour which you have to book ahead of time and, as are all sights in Prague, it is a bit pricey. Interesting fact about the **National** and **Municipal Library**: During the flood in 2002 significant portions of their collections where hit by the water and born from the necessity to act quickly the librarians opted to freeze the manuscripts, staving off their immediate destruction from water damage or mold. Only later then, they had to come up with strategies to thaw and disinfect them gently.

Walking across the bridge between the Old Town and Lesser Prague we only stop once and are asked to come back at a later time should we want to take any pictures of the statues or the scenery unfolding before us. To high is the risk of the group dispersing and individuals loosing track the pack in the sea of tourists.

The tour ends at the **John Lennon Wall** and everyone is still in awe and processing all the impressions this beautiful city already left in us. The soft voice of melancholy about the tour being at its end is drowned out by the eager calls to explore the rest of Prague. Or at least a tiny bit more, who knows which hidden gems still wait to be discovered.

Kamil provides us with a whole catalog about recommendations regarding food, sights and activities and asks us to please decide, each individually, on the amount we'd like to pay for the tour. There is no pressure to pay a certain amount. Some students give 8€, some Americans 25€. Kamil gives each a friendly smile and an honest thanks and leaves us with the last lesson in Czeck.
