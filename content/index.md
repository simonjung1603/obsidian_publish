Hello out there, thanks for stopping by. What you are reading is a little travel log I am currently in the process of writing during my Interrail trip through central/eastern Europe. It is mainly intended for friends and my family to follow along but hey, if you are also interested in traveling through Europe or my experiences, go ahead. Maybe there is something here for you.

The rough agenda (although nothing is set in stone yet) is as follows:
- [[Interrail 2025 (1) Prague|Interrail 2025 (1) Prague]]
- Krakow
- Budapest
- Ljubljana
- Zagreb
- Bratislava
- Vienna

I'll add links to the corresponding notes once I arrive at the destination.
